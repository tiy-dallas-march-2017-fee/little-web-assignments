# Babel and Webpack Examples

These are some relatively small Babel and Webpack examples. These are things that `create-react-app` is already doing for you, but it's good to look under the covers a bit.

* [Basic Babel](step_0) - This is a basic babel configuration for transforming ES2015 to old-school JS.
* [Basic Webpack](step_1) - At its heart, Webpack is a bundler. This shows a very basic example of bundling.
* [Webpack + Babel](step_2) - What if you wanted to bundle *and* do a Babel transform. Here is how.
* [Webpack + Babel + React](step_3) - What if you want to bundle, do a Babel transform, *and* use React. Piece of cake.
